The length and position of the single tracks is read from the CUE
file, and new tracks are created accordingly. The tracks are named
according to the artist and album information contained in the CUE
file, and ID3 v2 tags are set accordingly. The MP3 file is not cut on
frame boundary, but on ADU (autonomous data unit) boundary, thus
avoiding glitches and cracks in the resulting MP3 files.
