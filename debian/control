Description: An MP3 and Ogg streamer supporting HTTP and RTP protocols
 poc is a suite of MP3 tools and MP3 streaming programs. It can stream
 MP3s over HTTP, RTP (RFC 2250 and RFC 3119) and a special protocol to
 enable the use of Forward Error Correction to protect the MP3 stream
 against packet loss. It can also stream OGGs over HTTP.
 .
 In addition to the streaming programs, poc contains two MP3 tools:
 mp3cue and mp3cut. mp3cue can cut a big MP3 file according to a
 tracklisting contained in a .cue file. mp3cut can split and
 concatenate MP3 files according to time slices given on the command
 line.
